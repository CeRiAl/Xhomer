<h2>Running Xhomer</h2>
Xhomer reads options from a configuration file at startup.  A sample configuration
file (xhomer.cfg) is included in the source distribution.  Xhomer first looks for
its configuration file in ~/.xhomerrc (i.e. in your home directory).  If this file
is not found, it looks for xhomer.cfg in the current directory.  (The format of
both files is identical)  Make sure the options in this file are set appropriately.
Please see the section titled "Emulator Configuration File" for details of this
file's format.  If neither file is found, a built-in default configuration is used.
This configuration attempts to boot a hard disk image named pos32.rd, from the
current directory.

Next, a disk image needs to be made available, for Xhomer to boot from.  This can
be either a floppy image or a hard disk image (see the "Download" section).  Make
sure that the configuration file points to this image (the default of the provided
configuration file is to look for "pos32.rd"  in ".." - i.e. one directory level
up).

Once these steps have been completed, the emulator can be started by running the
"xhomer" binary.

If running in windowed mode, the top of the window frame will display the emulator
up-time (in seconds), the emulated CPU performance in TIPS ("thousand instructions
per second"), and the state of the Pro's four LEDs (0 indicates off, and 1
indicates on).
