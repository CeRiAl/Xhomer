<h2>Emulator Control Menu</h2>
Some of the emulator's configuration can be changed at runtime, through an on-screen
menu.  This menu also needs to be accessed to shut the emulator down.  To access the
control menu, press ctrl-F1, while the emulator window has focus.  A transparent menu
will be overlaid on top of the emulator window.  The emulator will continue to run.
When the menu is active, the item selection bar can be moved up and down with the up
and down arrow keys.  Press enter to select a particular item.  Also, when the menu
is active, the menu intercepts the up and down arrow keys and the enter and "Do" keys.
Other key presses are passed on to the emulated system.  Options which are not
implemented yet or are not changeable are grayed out and can not be selected.

Following is a description of the various menu items:

  Return to emulator

    This turns the menu off.

  Screen mode

    The current screen mode is displayed ("window" or "full").  Selecting this item
    will toggle the screen mode.

  rx0

    The name of the floppy image connected to the first emulated floppy drive is
    displayed.  Selecting this item will simulate a "floppy door open" event on
    the emulator and will allow a different floppy image to be selected.  Selecting
    the blank line at the top of the sub-menu will allow an empty floppy drive to
    be simulated.  Directories are marked with a leading "D."  ".." will go up one
    level in the directory structure and "." will stay in the current directory
    (not a terribly useful opton!).  Once an image has been selected, the emulator
    will check its size.  If it is not exactly 409,600 bytes, it will refuse to
    attach it as a floppy image.  But, if the image passes the size test, a
    "floppy door close" event is simulated, and the emulator is permitted to
    access the floppy image.

  rx1

    This option is similar to "rx0," except that it specifies the name of the
    floppy image connected to the second emulated floppy drive.

  rd0

    This shows the name of the current hard disk emulation file.  It is not a run-
    time changeable option.

  com

    This shows the name of the serial device that is used to emulate the
    communications port.  Selecting this item will allow a different assignment to
    be made.  Note that serial devices which are currently assigned to other ports
    (i.e. they're in use) are grayed out and may not be selected (except for the
    "null" device, which may be connected to multiple ports).

  ptr

    This shows the name of the serial device that is used to emulate the printer
    port, and allows it to be changed.

  kb

    This shows the name of the serial device that is used to emulate the keyboard.
    It should generally be set to lk201.  Although, it is possible to connect a
    real LK201 to a serial port.

  Save configuration
  Restore defaults and reset
  Reset

    These options are not implemented yet.

  About XHOMER

    This is pretty self-explanatory.

  Shutdown emulator

    Selecting this option will cause the emulator to shut down and exit.
