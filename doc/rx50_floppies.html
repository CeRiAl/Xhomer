<h2>Reading and Writing Real RX50 Floppies</h2>
The emulator is not able to read and write real RX50 floppies directly.  However, on
a Linux system, it is possible to convert RX50 floppies to disk image files, and vice
versa.  A 1.2 MB 5.25" floppy drive is needed for this.  The following entry should
be added to the /etc/fdprm file on the Linux system that has the floppy drive
attached:

  #               size sec/t hds trk stre  gap rate spec1 fmt_gap
  RX50             800    10   1  80    0 0x14 0x01  0xDF    0x18

Then, assuming the 5.25" floppy drive is /dev/fd1, the RX50 parameters should be set
from a shell prompt (as root) with:

  setfdprm /dev/fd1 RX50

Next, the dd command can be used to read and write RX50 floppies.  For example, to
convert an entire floppy into an image file:

  dd if=/dev/fd1 of=floppy_image

This should produce a 409,600 byte file.  To write an entire floppy from such a file:

  dd if=floppy_image of=/dev/fd1

I have had very good luck reading Pro floppies this way.  However, for disks that I
have written, I've had some problems reading the last couple of tracks on a real Pro.
