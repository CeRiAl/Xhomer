<h2>Performance</h2>
The original Pro ran at a speed of probably not much more than about 0.3 MIPS.  The
emulated speed varies, according to the activity being performed.  I've seen speeds
in the range of 1 MIPS (heavy screen scrolling in windowed mode) to 5 MIPS (sitting
idle in P/OS), on an 866 MHz Pentium-III machine running Red Hat Linux 8.0.

Xhomer is based on the J11 processor core from the SIMH simulator.  Profiling
various operating systems running on this core (with gprof) showed that the
simulator was spending a significant portion of its time performing virtual to
physical address translations.  In Xhomer, this translation function has been
accelerated through the use of a small cache (effectively a simple TLB), resulting
in about a 10% overall performance boost.

Following are performance benchmarks from various different host machines.  These
numbers were measured with Xhomer sitting idle at the P/OS main menu screen.
