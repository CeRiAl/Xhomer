<h2>Emulated Keyboard, Printer and Communications Ports</h2>
The Pro's keyboard, printer and communications ports may be mapped to a number of
different devices and pseudo-devices in the host system.  These mappings are
specified in the emulator configuration file, and may also be changed at runtime,
through the emulator control menu.  The list of real devices is as follows:

  serial0
  serial1
  serial2
  serial3

    Each of these devices may be defined to map to a different physical port in
    the host system.  Please see the "Emulator Configuration File" section.

The list of pseudo-devices includes:

  digipad

    This is a partial emulation of a GTCO Micro Digipad, a digitizing tablet.  The
    X-windows mouse is used to emulate this device.  The emulation of this device
    is not complete, and it should not be considered reliable.

  lk201

    This is an emulation of the Pro's LK201 keyboard, using the X-windows keyboard.
    Please see the "LK201 Keyboard Mapping" section for a description of how the
    keys are mapped.

  la50

    This is a partial LA50 printer emulator.  It converts Sixel graphics commands
    (as produced by P/OS) to PCL.  This pseudo-device needs to be told where to
    send its output.  This is done through the "la50" option in the configuration
    file.  There is also an "la50_dpi" option associated with this pseudo device,
    to set the print density.  Please see the "Emulator Configuration File"
    section for more information.

  null

    This is a dummy device that leaves the associated port disconnected.

The emulated keyboard, printer port and communications port are "connected" to
devices by making assignments to the variables "kb," "ptr," and "com," respectively,
in the emulator configuration file.

Examples:

To emulate the Pro's keyboard through the X-windows keyboard, specify the following
in the emulator configuration file:

  kb = lk201

To connect the Pro's communications port directly to the first serial port on a
typical Linux PC (/dev/ttyS0), specify the following (serial0 is chosen
arbitrarily):

  serial0 = /dev/ttyS0
  com = serial0

To connect the Pro's printer port to a 300 DPI HP PCL laser printer connected to a
printer port on a typical Linux PC (/dev/lp0), while emulating the Sixel printing
capabilities of an LA50, specify (serial1 is chosen arbitrarily):

  serial1 = /dev/lp0
  la50 = serial1
  la50_dpi = 300
  ptr = la50
  lp_workaround = on

Note that, depending on the device privileges on the host system, it might be
necessary to run Xhomer with root privileges, to access the various physical ports.
