<h2>Change Log</h2>
9-16-06:

  -Removed bits 0..2 of MMR3, to match the F11 more closely.

  -Added emulation of the maintenance terminal interface (printer port
   functionality only - no MicroODT).  This is used by the 2.9BSD
   installation floppy.  See the configuration file documentation.

  -Added byte-write support for video memory (used by 2.9BSD).

  -Added experimental "periodic interrupt throttle" feature, to allow the
   real-time clock to keep up on slower host systems.  See the new
   "int_throttle" option in the configuration file documentation.  The
   option is off by default.

  -Recoded part of pro_clk, to remove dependency on 64-bit integers.

  -Added various simple build scripts, which can be used instead of the
   Makefile:

     make.simple: This is a minimal build script that should allow
       easier initial builds on currently unsupported platforms.

     make.sgi: This script builds Xhomer on SGI Irix, using the
       standard SGI MIPS compiler.

  -Added performance data from various host machines on the "performance"
   page.

12-14-03:

  First public release of Xhomer.
