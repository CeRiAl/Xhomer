Using Xhomer
------------
These are very basic instructions, for building, running and
exiting the Xhomer DEC Pro 350 emulator.  For more detailed
documentation, please see DOC/index.html.  Also, up-to-date
documentation and source code can be obtained from:

  http://xhomer.isani.org/


Building Xhomer
---------------
Xhomer has been developed and tested on a Linux x86/GNU/X-windows
system.  It is written in C, and will likely build on other
Unix systems, but the Makefile might require some tweaks.  It
is assumed that the version of make in use is Gnu make (gmake)
and that gcc will be used for compilation.

From the directory in which this README resides:

1. Run "make clean"

2. Run "make"

   This should produce a dynamically-linked executable named
   "xhomer," in the current directory.

3. (OPTIONAL) If you would like a statically-linked executable,

   run "make xhomer.static"

   This will produce a binary named xhomer.static


Running Xhomer
--------------
1. Obtain a Pro hard disk image file (pos32.rd or venix2.rd, for
   example).

2. Modify the Xhomer configuration file (xhomer.cfg), if necessary,
   to point to the hard disk image (using the "rd_dir" and "rd0"
   variables).  xhomer.cfg must exist in the directory Xhomer is
   run from.  Alternatively, the file can be copied to ~/.xhomerrc.
   If ~/.xhomerrc exists, it will be used instead of xhomer.cfg.
   The provided configuration file contains documentation for all
   of its options.  Make sure they are set appropriately.

3. Run "xhomer"

   The operating system present on the disk image file should now
   boot.


Exiting Xhomer
--------------
1. While the Xhomer window has focus, press ctrl-F1.

2. The emulator control menu should now be visible.  Select
   the "Shutdown emulator" option with the up/down arrow keys, and
   press enter.
