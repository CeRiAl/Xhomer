<h2>Pro 350 Software</h2>
P/OS 3.2 and Venix 2.0 both run on Xhomer.  I built hard disk images for both from the
floppy images available from:

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/professional/">ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/professional/</A>

There is additional Pro software available on the above site, in the form of floppy
images.  These images are of a different format than those supported by Xhomer.  To
convert them, one must first write the images out to real floppies (using the LHA/
Teledisk method described on that site) and then convert them back to the format
recognized by Xhomer, using the technique described in the section titled "Reading
and Writing Real RX50 Floppies."

P/OS and Venix hard disk images, as well as converted images of the P/OS 3.2
installation floppies are available in the "Download" section.
