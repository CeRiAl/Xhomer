<h1>The Xhomer Project</h1>
<img src="title.gif">
<pre>
Xhomer is a machine emulator for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pro 350 computer, a
PDP-11-based machine that was sold in the early to mid-'80's.  Xhomer is based on the PDP-11
CPU core from the <A HREF="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SIMH simulator</A>, and is written entirely in C.

<a name=supported_platforms>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
Xhomer is an X-windows application that was developed and tested on an x86 Linux system
(Ubuntu 20.04, most recently).  It will likely build and run on other Unix-like systems as well,
possibly requiring minor tweaks to the Makefile.  In addition to the source, a completely
statically-linked x86 Linux binary is provided.

<a name=quick_start>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
If you have access to an x86 Linux system, and would like to see a quick demo of Xhomer,
only two files are required.  Download this <A HREF="xhomer.static.tgz">statically-linked Xhomer binary</A> and the
<A HREF="pos32.rd.gz">P/OS 3.2 hard disk image file</A>.  Untar the binary (the tarball contains a single executable
only) and gunzip the disk image in the same directory (the latter expands to about 67 MB):

  gunzip -dc xhomer.static.tgz | tar xvf -
  gunzip pos32.rd.gz

Next, simply run "xhomer.static."  Note that this static binary is an older version of Xhomer (9-16-06) To exit Xhomer,
make sure the emulator window has focus, then press ctrl-F1, and select the "Shutdown emulator" option.

  (these are only needed to build a new P/OS hard disk image from scratch)

(Caution: Some web browsers might remove the ".gz" extension from the disk image filenames, without
actually decompressing them.  If this happens, add the ".gz" extension back manually before running
gunzip.)

<h2>Feedback</h2>
Feedback, questions, bug reports, patches, etc. are always welcome.  Also, I would be very
interested in hearing whether anyone is able to run other operating systems.
