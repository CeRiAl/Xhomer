<h2>Change Log</h2>
2-19-24:

  -Added documentation and disk image for running 2.9BSD

  -Fixed DIV bug in pdp11_cpu.c

  -Added NO_OCTTY to serial port open

  -Added patch scripts for 2.9 BSD installation floppy

  -Added max 128 mb disk geometry auto detection to pro_rd.c

  -scp now works when no terminal is connected

  -xhomer.static is currently not supported for new builds (web site contains old 9-16-06 build)

  -Added exit_on_halt option for xhomer.cfg (in support of "reboot -h" for 2.9 BSD)

9-16-06:

  -Removed bits 0..2 of MMR3, to match the F11 more closely.

  -Added emulation of the maintenance terminal interface (printer port
   functionality only - no MicroODT).  This is used by the 2.9BSD
   installation floppy.  See the configuration file documentation.

  -Added byte-write support for video memory (used by 2.9BSD).

  -Added experimental "periodic interrupt throttle" feature, to allow the
   real-time clock to keep up on slower host systems.  See the new
   "int_throttle" option in the configuration file documentation.  The
   option is off by default.

  -Recoded part of pro_clk, to remove dependency on 64-bit integers.

  -Added various simple build scripts, which can be used instead of the
   Makefile:

     make.simple: This is a minimal build script that should allow
       easier initial builds on currently unsupported platforms.

     make.sgi: This script builds Xhomer on SGI Irix, using the
       standard SGI MIPS compiler.

  -Added performance data from various host machines on the "performance"
   page.

12-14-03:

  First public release of Xhomer.
