<h2>Building Xhomer</h2>
Download and untar the source tarball and enter the xhomer-(version) directory.  If
building on a Linux system, the following should be sufficient:

  1. make clean

  2. make

     This builds the dynamically-linked executable (xhomer).

  3. (optional) make xhomer.static

     This builds the statically-linked executable (xhomer.static).

  4. (optional) setuid_root_xhomer

     You will be prompted for your root password.  This gives root privileges to
     any Xhomer binaries that were just built.  This is necessary if you would like
     to run Xhomer in full-screen mode (DGA) and possibly to access certain
     peripherals (such as serial and printer ports), depending on how the privileges
     on your system are set.  Otherwise, this step is not needed.

The Makefile is written for gnu make (gmake) and assumes the presence of gcc.  If
building on a Unix or Unix-like system, other than Linux, minor tweaks to this file
might be necessary, although the Makefile has been known to work on HP-UX and Solaris
(with gcc and gmake installed) without modification.

The Makefile attempts to auto-detect the presence of DGA1 and DGA2 on the build
system.  In case this auto-detection causes problems, it may be overidden.  Please
see the Makefile itself for details.
