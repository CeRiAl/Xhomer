<h1>The Xhomer Project</h1>

<pre>
Xhomer is a machine emulator for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pro 350 computer, a
PDP-11-based machine that was sold in the early to mid-'80's.  Xhomer is based on the PDP-11
CPU core from the <A HREF="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SIMH simulator</A>, and is written entirely in C.

<a name=supported_platforms>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
Xhomer is an X-windows application that was developed and tested on an x86 Linux system (Red
Hat 8.0, most recently).  It will likely build and run on other Unix-like systems as well,
possibly requiring minor tweaks to the Makefile.  In addition to the source, a completely
statically-linked x86 Linux binary is provided.

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
If you have access to an x86 Linux system, and would like to see a quick demo of Xhomer,
only two files are required.  Download this <A HREF="xhomer.static.tgz">statically-linked Xhomer binary</A> and the
<A HREF="pos32.rd.gz">P/OS 3.2 hard disk image file</A>.  Untar the binary (the tarball contains a single executable
only) and gunzip the disk image in the same directory (the latter expands to about 67 MB):

  gunzip -dc xhomer.static.tgz | tar xvf -
  gunzip pos32.rd.gz

Next, simply run "xhomer.static."  To exit Xhomer, make sure the emulator window has focus,
then press ctrl-F1, and select the "Shutdown emulator" option.
