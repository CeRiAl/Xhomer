  "tagline": "Xhomer is a machine emulator for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pro 350 computer, a PDP-11-based machine that was sold in the early to mid-'80's.  Xhomer is based on the PDP-11 CPU core from the SIMH simulator, and is written entirely in C.",
  "body": "Xhomer README\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nPlease read the file LICENSE, in this directory, for details.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Xhomer\r\n------------\r\nThese are very basic instructions, for building, running and\r\nexiting the Xhomer DEC Pro 350 emulator.  For more detailed\r\ndocumentation, please see DOC/index.html.  Also, up-to-date\r\ndocumentation and source code can be obtained from:\r\n\r\n  http://xhomer.isani.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding Xhomer\r\n---------------\r\nXhomer has been developed and tested on a Linux x86/GNU/X-windows\r\nsystem.  It is written in C, and will likely build on other\r\nUnix systems, but the Makefile might require some tweaks.  It\r\nis assumed that the version of make in use is Gnu make (gmake)\r\nand that gcc will be used for compilation.\r\n\r\nFrom the directory in which this README resides:\r\n\r\n1. Run \"make clean\"\r\n\r\n2. Run \"make\"\r\n\r\n   This should produce a dynamically-linked executable named\r\n   \"xhomer,\" in the current directory.\r\n\r\n3. (OPTIONAL) If you would like a statically-linked executable,\r\n\r\n   run \"make xhomer.static\"\r\n\r\n   This will produce a binary named xhomer.static\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning Xhomer\r\n--------------\r\n1. Obtain a Pro hard disk image file (pos32.rd or venix2.rd, for\r\n   example).\r\n\r\n2. Modify the Xhomer configuration file (xhomer.cfg), if necessary,\r\n   to point to the hard disk image (using the \"rd_dir\" and \"rd0\"\r\n   variables).  xhomer.cfg must exist in the directory Xhomer is\r\n   run from.  Alternatively, the file can be copied to ~/.xhomerrc.\r\n   If ~/.xhomerrc exists, it will be used instead of xhomer.cfg.\r\n   The provided configuration file contains documentation for all\r\n   of its options.  Make sure they are set appropriately.\r\n\r\n3. Run \"xhomer\"\r\n\r\n   The operating system present on the disk image file should now\r\n   boot.\r\n\r\n\r\nExiting Xhomer\r\n--------------\r\n1. While the Xhomer window has focus, press ctrl-F1.\r\n\r\n2. The emulator control menu should now be visible.  Select\r\n   the \"Shutdown emulator\" option with the up/down arrow keys, and\r\n   press enter.\r\n",
